# PRODIGY_DS_03
This project uses a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service. The model is built using Python, leveraging the Scikit-learn library, and trained on the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
